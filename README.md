### Introduction 
What is Machine Learning: is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. <br /> 
How can you use it: People can use machine learning to do things such as show customized ads or recognize habitual patterns that humans do through experience. 

### Types of Machine Learning techniques
Supervised Learning: machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. <br /> 
Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision.

### Chapter 1: Linear Regression with One Variable
What is Linear regression: Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. ... Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). This is a supervised learning that essentially predicts based on a given set of independent variables. Can not be used in  <br /> 
Why do we use linear regression: We use linear regression when a set of values are already given to you. This makes it easier to compile the set of data and create a prediction as well as a line of best yet. <br />
