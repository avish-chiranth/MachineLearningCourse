### Introduction 
What is Machine Learning?: is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. 
How can you use it?: People can use machine learning to do things such as show customized ads or recognize habitual patterns that humans do through experience. 

### Types of Machine Learning techniques
Supervised: machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.
Unsupervised: Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision.
